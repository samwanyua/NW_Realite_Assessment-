Subject: Portfolio Performance & Arrears Overview â€“ NW REALITE

Dear Head of Property Management,

Following the recent analysis of our NW REALITE portfolio, I am pleased to report strong overall performance. The total annual rent generated stands at approximately KES 7 million, with an overall occupancy rate of 91.67%, reflecting robust demand and effective lease management. The average monthly rent collected per unit is KES 48,167, indicating consistency in our rental pricing across properties.

However, the portfolio is currently tracking KES 28,000 in total arrears. Analysis shows that NSF Towers, Delta Corner, and The Junction Residences are the top contributors to these arrears, suggesting a need to focus collection efforts on these properties. 

Recommended actions include: conducting lease audits to ensure all agreements are accurately recorded; establishing a regular arrears follow-up cadence for high-risk tenants; reviewing rental pricing and potential incentives to improve timely payments; and addressing any data quality issues identified during cleaning, such as negative rent or missing end dates.

Implementing these measures will help sustain high occupancy while reducing arrears and improving overall collection efficiency.

Best regards,

Samuel Wanyua
Data Analyst
